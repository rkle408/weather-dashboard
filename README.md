## Utilizing OpenWeather One Call API to render weather data for your city of choice!


## Special Notes:
Had to change the API key after commit #20 due to not being in .gitignore, and they did require a credit card for One Call 3.0 subscription.

UV Index now has 5 classifications of exposure, and I added the background color per their new standards.
